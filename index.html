            <h3>Urban Modern Residential Design</h3>
            <p>
                This was my first residential interior design project, created during Semester 1.
                The design explores the <strong>Urban Modern</strong> style, combining sleek modern elements with raw textures and bold contrasts.
                It focuses on functionality, minimalism, and comfort tailored for contemporary living.

               <strong>Presentation:</strong> 9 August 2024</p>
